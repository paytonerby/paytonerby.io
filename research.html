	<p class="p2">Gray, Richard. June 24, 2024. The real reason why sharks attack humans. BBC.</p>
	<p class="p1">A dark sahdow underneath the 13-year-old's feet made her lift her feet from the water. That dark shadow belonged to a great white shark. The surfer's cousin, 33, punched the shark to get the shark away from the victim. This led to to the shark to release the teenage surfer and swim away.</p>
	<p class ="p1">The surfer had noticed how the shark was circling around them under the water before the attack. This shark attack victim is one of nearly 83 people in the world that have been attacked unrpovoked by a shark during the year of 2009.</p>
	<p class="p1">According to the Florida Museum of Natrual History's International Shark Attack File, in 2023, there were 69 unprovoked shark bites and 22 provoked shark bites from shark attacks.</p></p>
	<p class="p1">14 of these attacks were fatal, which included 10 of those considered as unprovoked. After the surfers attack, many of her loved ones refused to get back in the water due to the fear of being attacked by a shark.</p>

		<p class="p1">Sharks attack humans when they are noticed in their own territory. This is because they are feeling threatned. This is most effective during breeding season to feel most threatned.</p>
		<p class="p1"> Sharks attack due to the fact they are curious. This leads to fatal injuries and sometimes death. 87% of shsrk attacks are unprovoked.</p>
		<p class="p1">Sharks are hungry and gegt tired of feasting on their nromal diets. Humans are often mistaken as new food sources. Possible climate changes or pollution can cause sharks to prey on humans, which is a potential increase on a new feeding habit.</p>
		<p class="p1">Pollution ot other chmeical water changes make sharks more aggressive or erratic. If humans fight back against a shark attack, this may caus the shark to become more aggressive on its prey. Hammerhead sharks are also known to hit a human with their head before fully attacking.</p>
