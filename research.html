<ul>
<li>A dark shadow underneath the 13-year-old’s feet made her lift her feet from the water 
</li>
<ddd> - The dark shadow had been a great white shark.</ddd>
<li>Surfer’s cousin, 33, punched the shark to get the shark away from the victim
</li>
<ddd> - This led the shark to release and swim away</ddd>
<li>The surfer had noticed how the shark was circling them underwater</li>
<li>The surfer is one of nearly 83 people in the world that have been attacked unprovoked by a shark during the year of 2009. </li>
<li>In 2023</li>
<ddd>- 69 unprovoked shark bites on humans</ddd>
<ddd>- 22 provoked shark bites on humans </ddd>
<dd> - According to the Florida Museum of Natural History’s International Shark Attack File</dd>
<dd>- 14 of these attacks were fatal-, which included 10 of those considered being unprovoked</dd>
<dd>- “Shark bites are strongly correlated to the number of people and number of sharks in the water at the same time.” (Gray, par 15).</dd>
<dd> -Gavin Naylor, Director of the Florida Program for Shark Research - International Shark Attack File </dd>
<ddd> - After the surfers attack, many of her loved ones refused to get back in the water due to fear of being attacked by a shark</ddd>

Anti-Sharks Club
			<ul>
				<li>Sharks attack humans when noticed in their own territory</li>
				<ddd> - Fear of feeling threatened</ddd>
				<ddd>- Most effective during breeding season to feel threatened </ddd>
				<li>Sharks attack due to the fact they are curious </li>
				<ddd>- Lead to fatal injuries and sometimes death</ddd>
				<dd>- Lead to fatal injuries and sometimes death</dd>
				<li>Sharks are hungry and get tired of feasting on their normal diets</li>
				<ddd>- Humans are often mistaken as new food sources</ddd>
				<ddd>- Possible climate changes or pollution can cause sharks to prey on humans</ddd>
				<dd>- Potential increase on a new feeding habit</dd>
				<li>Pollution or other chemical water changes make sharks more aggressive or erratic</li>
				<li>If humans fight back against a shark attack, this may cause the shark to become more aggressive on its prey</li>
				<li>Hammerhead sharks tend to hit a human with their head before fully attacking</li>
