    <p>Starting it out, it feels like a common way that kids grow up. Kids are always asking their parents many questions that do not exactly have a real purpose behind them. Such as the question “how do railroad crossings work”. Random for a parent to answer, but they still choose to answer them. For a more sufficient answer though, they would say to look it up. The web has helped make answering questions a lot easier with one simple search engine. This article gives a rundown on how the author, Kate Wagner, grew up using the internet and the web as it progressed through time. It almost makes me want to go back and think of how I used to browse the web when I was growing up. When I was younger, all I tried to do was figure out how to use the internet and how to navigate it. Something I have never really realized was how as the internet increased to greater ways to use, social media apps and websites came along with it. Wagner mentions how Myspace and Facebook came along the internet train, followed by Instagram. I have never realized that the more the web and internet progressed itself, new social apps came along until now. It seems that the smarter the web got, the more social media apps also got smarter. One thing I noticed years ago is how any question you would want to look up on the internet, you can more than likely find in a book.</p>
      
    <p>Wagner talks about the difference between the development in Web Version 2.0 and Web Version 1.0. The big difference that Wagner mentioned in her essay I noticed was how in version 1.0, users would have to code manually, as well as look after their own interactive spaces such as social media websites like Facebook. As for the upgraded version, users did not have to worry about managing their spaces on the web because the web did it for you in a sense. Not only were social media apps managed manually, but so were emails. Wagner states that Olia Lialina believes that Web Version 2.0 is broader. As time went by and the internet continued to grow, people have been able to use newer interactive media, for example, blogs. </p>
      
    <p>Wagner has more than once referred to the internet as ugly and beautiful at the same time. I agree with her when she makes these statements. The internet can be a beautiful and helpful place to search. People use the internet to help write essay papers for their classes as well as additional research on a family friendly vacation site in Mexico. However, the internet can be a dark hole of hell, hence the term ugly to be thrown into the mix. Earlier on in the essay, Wagner brought back the memory of how parents would tell their teenage kids to watch what they put on the internet because no matter what, it stays online forever. In any moment, an old photo that was once posted that was later deleted can be found back in the deep archives of the internet. It is definitely a place to be careful with. When using the internet, you want to have good awareness on what is being said and what photos or videos are being shared for friends to view. When I came across the “Facebook vs. Tweens” section of the essay, it automatically takes me back to the conversations I would have with my parents about how people on the internet can be cruel. Whether it be people on social media or on websites on its own.</p>
