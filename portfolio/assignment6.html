<h1>"Whatever Happened to the Sports Movie?" by Chris Smith</h1>
</header>


<p>Chris Smith believes that “big-budget sports blockbuster is a rarity” (Smith, par 3). About a year from now, sports fans will hopefully get treated with a new sports movie that they haven’t seen in multiple years. Smith goes into detailed statistics on sports movies. The movie "Days of Thunder" is a popular film about a NASCAR driver that raised $160 million of gross money, which earned more than the movie "Field of Dreams" from the year prior. Days of Thunder has since then become the highest-grossing sports movie since Sylvester Stallone’s movie series film Rocky IV. Sports movies earn great achievements, such as the movies The Blind Side, Million Dollar Baby, and Moneyball all earning an Oscars nomination. </p>
<p>However, Smith makes note of how theatrical sports movies have been on the decline for over ten years. This is a trend that began before the rise of streaming, as well as the pandemic shutting down all theaters. The co-founder of Sony Pictures Classics, Tom Bernard, has even run a concern about where these movies have gone. He notices how no other movie studios are making these types of underdog movies. The vice president of SMAC Entertainment, FredAnthony Smith, says that sports movies that follow league teams such as Little Big League and Rookie of the Year are films that grow on the sports world and lean them into original content to attract new fans.

	<p>Sports movies are movies that share beautiful but sad true stories. They also play off of pure entertainment for all athletes and sport fans. Being an athlete myself, I enjoy sports movies based on true stories and those that are just for entertainment. Movies like The Blind Side, Radio, League Of Their Own, and Coach Carter are just a select few of my favorite sports movies that tell true stories or that are inspired by true events. It takes you into the world and the life that teams, athletes, or coaches go through and can give a sense of heartwarming feelings or bring tons of energy.</p>
	<p>The last sports movie I had seen in theaters was The Iron Claw back in 2023, which was about the wrestling family of brothers, the Von Erich family. More sports movies have hit the theaters between Challengers (2024) and Queen of the Ring (2024). But something that I can agree on with Chris Smith and Tom Bernard is that these genres of movies aren’t being made as often as they used to. The underdog stories are always fun to tell through the movie screen, such as Rookie of the Year and even The Waterboy. They aren’t created as often as they used to. It’s obvious that sports movies like these have earned high greatness and achievements with countless award nominations and wins. Clearly, these movies are a success. When a story is told about a team, a coach, or an athlete is portrayed well on the movie screen, it moves many athletes and sport lovers, that have even inspired many.</p>
