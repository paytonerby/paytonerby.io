		<p>Though, around the world, there are people who are pro sharks. But why should humans be pro-sharks if sharks are anti-humans? But another question is why do sharks attack humans? Sharks often attack humans that are surfing in the ocean. Whether it is out of curiosity or because sharks are tired of eating on their diet, they feast on human flesh. Thinking about how many fish eat other fish and the food chain ranking, sharks still feast on fish. But, with how often sharks attack, sharks begin to run out of normal fish to eat. Therefore, if a human is spotted in their line of vision, their next move is human flesh.  Ever think about the different shark breeds and how they seem to attack their human prey? Would a hammer head swing on a human like a hammer with its head? Do megamouth sharks only attack younger humans? Do whale sharks attack older humans? These are questions that are important to think about the safety of surfers, divers, and ocean lovers. Marine Biologists need to dive deeper into the dietary needs of sharks to figure out what the real cause is for sharks to attack humans when humans truly mind their own business while near shark territory. </p>
		<p>Do sharks feel threatened when us humans tend to be in their territory in the ocean? Itâ€™s possible. What living thing would want a total stranger in their own territory. But when humans are simply not bothering them while on their surfboard, having a good time swimming out to the ocean, what is the real need to attack? The point of sharks truly attacking humans is a true conspiracy and I plan to uncover it truthfully.
